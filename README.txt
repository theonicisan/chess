The main Jupyter Notebooks are:

1) create_dictionary_fastload.ipynb: This generates random replay buffers and writes them away to a Teradata database.
2) build_tree.ipynb: This builds a tree of n-level depth where the leaf nodes are the starting points of the subsequent plays through to a critical state.
